# Code generation

Follow these instructions when generating code:

- Run `pnpm check` after generating code to fix them by Biome
- Run `pnpm typecheck` to make sure the code is not violating type rules
- Ensure all generated code follows the established patterns and conventions in this project
- **Avoid code duplication** by reusing existing utilities and components
