## CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

#### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- Runs on pull requests to the main branch
- Performs type checking, testing, linting, and building
- Automatically commits linting fixes
- Includes auto-merge functionality for Dependabot PRs

#### Deploy Workflow (`.github/workflows/sourcemaps.yml`)

- Runs on pushes to the main branch
- Builds the application with sourcemaps enabled
- Automatically uploads sourcemaps to Sentry for error tracking
- Requires `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `SENTRY_DSN` secrets to be configured in repository settings

### Sentry Integration

Sourcemaps are automatically uploaded to Sentry when:

- Code is pushed to the main branch
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is provided as a repository secret
- The build process completes successfully

This enables better error tracking and debugging in production.

#### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:

- `SENTRY_DSN` - Your Sentry DSN for error tracking (required for server-side Sentry, optional for client-side which defaults to the project's DSN)
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` - Sentry authentication token for sourcemap uploads (required for CI/CD)

**Note**: Server-side Sentry requires the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable to be set, as `useRuntimeConfig` cannot be used in the server configuration file due to technical limitations.
